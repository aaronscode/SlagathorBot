# SlagathorBot
## Overview
The ultimate goal of this project is to be a chat-bot that can be interacted with in a skype group chat or similar format. Ultimately, the idea is to train a neural network using a corpus of messages, and then have the neural network interfaced with a skype account so that it can add messages to a chat or respond to being directly addressed. There will be several stages to this project, each of which is broken out as a module in it's own subfolder of this main repository. The components are listed below:

## Components
